pypgf
=====

A Python interface for creating LaTeX plots with Christian FeuersÃ¤nger's
[PGFPlots][1] and Till Tantau's [PGF/TikZ][2] package. The interface is still at
a very rudimentary stage, might change heavily in the future and lacks
documentation. If you use an operating system other than Mac, you will have to
change the `pdf_view` setting in `settings.py`.
